# Epitech-templates

This repository contains a collection of base templates designed to save time when starting new Epitech projects.

Because Epitech automatically creates empty repositories for students, this cannot be defined as a true GitHub template repository. Instead, it provides ready-to-use structures and CI/CD setups that can be copied manually into new projects.
